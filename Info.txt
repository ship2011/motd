Purpose : If you are in enviornment where you have to manage many servers and you need to communicate with server's owner or applciation
owner about server and you are logged on server, don't want to go at your monitoring tool or csv/excel file to get server's owner or 
application owner email ID and description to email/contact them about server then it is very helpful to update this info in motd file to
make your life easier.

Challanges :
1 . If you have more than 1000 servers then it is very tedious to update motd file on each server.
2 . lets presume you have created playbook to update motd file then it will be also very tedious to define severs owner's email ID,
description in varabiles for each servers.

Now Question : How to make automate it?
To automate it  2 componets are necessary.
1 - you should have ansible configured on one server in your enviornemnt and that server will have access to all servers  (usually in
large enviroment there must be a master server or jump server "whatever you called it" that server uses to access your infrastcture servers.)
2 - you should have all servers name, description....etc in .csv file (If you are in large enviroment then you must have this informaiton
in .csv/excel file or you can fetch this information from your monitoring tools in .csv/excel format because many montiroing tools provide export funcanlity to import information in .csv file)
